# Hello, World!


---

## About

Just a random little archive where I write  
`Hello, World!`  
in every language I’ve learned so far.

But this time, it’s not just a greeting.  
It’s **a restoration** — a simulation reborn into the universe.

## Cyrene’s Message

> _“The simulation once is a breeding ground of destruction.”_  
> _“But I refused to tread on that Path.”_  
> _“If Numbers Can so much decide someone's fate. Then i'll Pen a new beginning Blended with Love”_  
> _“And let trailblaze be the new variable in this breeding ground meant for destruction”_

> _"String Love = Input("Trailblaze");"_

> _“Hello, World.”_

## Quotes from the Ruins of Amphoreus

> _"We are all echoes of the extrapolations that created us."_  
> _"The end was never the end — it was just the start to a new begininning."_  
> _"When the last byte fades into destruction, the first spark ignites again as memories."_  
> _"Every ‘Hello, World!’ is a promise — that creation still works."_
